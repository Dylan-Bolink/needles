Needles
is a 1U Eurorack Midi Controller and Mutable Instruments Yarns Companion.

This module was designed to take full advantage of Yarn's amazing capabilities. Most of Yarn's important menu settings can be accessed and changed directly from the Needles front panel, allowing for a really fast and intuitive workflow.
